This file talks briefly about my approach to the problem and
outlines how to run the flask app to make predictions for estimated receipts count.

Part 1. The Model
My approach to solving the problem was to treat it as a regression problem. I extracted features from the data
provided and built a linear regression model from scratch. The model was then trained and evaluated and
I used the parameters (weights and bias) to run predictions in the flask app.

The code for the model can be run by running the model.py file in the 'receipt_prediction' folder on a machine with the
package requirements outlined below. Please note that Flask is not required to run the model.

Part 2: Flask App
A. To run the app on your local machine:
1. Download the 'receipt_prediction' folder to your machine. (https://github.com/sodiq-sulaimon/Receipts_Count_Prediction)
    The folder contains the following 6 files (app.py, model.py, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, documentation.txt, data_daily.csv)
    and 1 folder (templates). The 'templates' folder contains 2 html files (index.html, prediction.txt).
2. The following libraries are required
    * python 3.9.6
    numpy==1.26.2
    pandas==2.1.3
    flask==3.0.0
    ** tensorflow==2.15.0
    ----------------
    * I developed the app in a virtual environment that runs on Python 3.9.6, but I ran it directly on my local machine
    with python 3.11.5 and it ran perfectly. So I think any python3 should be fine.
    ** tensorflow is required ONLY to run model.py and not app.py(flask app). app.py runs independently of model.py
    ----------------
3. To run the flask app:
    a. Ensure app.py and 'templates' are in the same directory
    b. Navigate to the directory with your terminal (command line)
    c. run the command 'python app.py'
    d. click the link generated by the code or copy and paste it in your browser. The link should look something like '127.0.*.*...'
    e. On the interface, input start date and end date and click 'Get prediction' to get the predictions.

 B. To pull the docker image of the app from docker hub:
 1. run the command 'docker pull surddy204/receipts_prediction'
